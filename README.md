HR MANAGEMENT


All the users should have a profile page, which should include name, image and date of joining, designation, profile(developer drupal, angular etc)
We should store projectwise time involvement of a user (in percentage), it should also store whether his involvement in the project is billable or not.
We should store projectwise to whom a user reports.
A page should show all users name, projects involved, total time of him being used (in percentage) filtered by billable and non billable.
A page, where for a user shows total time, total billable, total non billable, then same projectwise with all the users who reports him and user whom he reports.
